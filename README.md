# Fetching dogs API full stack app example

### Running the project
Firstly, the npm packages need to be installed for both the client and server. To do this, cd into the directories from your command line and run `npm install`.

After the packages have been installed, you can now run both the client and the server:
* To start the server, open a command line, cd to the server directory and run  `npm run start`
* To start the client, open a separate command line window, cd to the client and run `npm run start`
* You can start both the client and server running `npm run dev`
